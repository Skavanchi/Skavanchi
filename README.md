- 👋 Hi, I’m @Skavanchi
- 👀 I’m interested in Disc golf, Cycling, Fishing, Tech, Computers, Video game, Books and Movies.
- 🌱 I’m currently developing a batch based text adventure game currently called Project Xero and its underlying engine called Clock Work.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ......... Really anything you think you can add to the project. I'm flying by the seat of my pants on this project and honestly I have no idea what the hell I'm doing. =)
- 📫 How to reach me: Email - Skavanchi@yahoo.com | Discord - Skavanchi | YT channel - https://www.youtube.com/@skavanchi
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm entirely self taught when it comes to batch... and it probably shows... (I never claimed to be good at this)
